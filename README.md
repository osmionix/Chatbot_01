PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Build BhilaiGPT: Craft a system with a user-friendly interface that solves all kinds of non-confidential queries regarding IIT Bhilai.

Proposal for Developing a Query Interface for IIT BHILAI

Introduction:
To optimize data access and boost operational effectiveness, we suggest creating a thorough query interface for IIT Bhilai. With the growing volume and complexity of data in educational institutions, it is critical to offer stakeholders a user-friendly platform for accessing and analyzing information effectively.

Objectives:
Improved Data Accessibility:
Students, instructors, and staff may easily access crucial information such as grades, course schedules, and academic records. 
Reduces the time and effort needed to get information from several systems and sources.
Enhanced Student Experience:
Students can track their academic progress, browse course materials, and access support services more effectively.
Facilitates student-faculty connection by offering a single forum for course-related questions and debates.
Streamlined Administrative Processes:
Allows instructors and staff to more efficiently handle course materials, student records, and administrative responsibilities.
Reduces administrative costs by automating common operations such as class registration, grade submission, and student enrolment.

Methodology:
Backend Coding with JavaScript:
We will be setting up a Node.js environment for backend development using JavaScript.
We will be using Express.js, a popular Node.js framework, to handle routing and middleware functions.
We will be Implementing RESTful API endpoints to interact with the server and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
Frontend Development with React.js:
We will be setting up a React.js project using tools like Create React App for scaffolding.
We will be designing and developing user interface components using JSX syntax and React hooks or class components.
We will be utilizing React Router for client-side routing to manage navigation within the application.
In the end we will Integrate with third-party libraries and UI frameworks as needed for enhanced functionality and styling.
Database Setup with MySQL:
We will be provisioning a MySQL database instance on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using services like Google Cloud SQL.
We will configure database settings, including user permissions, access controls, and security configurations.
We will establish connections between the Node.js backend and the MySQL database using MySQL drivers.
Deployment and Hosting:
We will deploy the Node.js backend application to Google Cloud Platform.
We will set up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins for automated deployment.
We will ensure proper monitoring and logging mechanisms are in place to track application performance, errors, and usage metrics.
Data Storage and Access Control:
We will implement data access controls and authentication mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive data.
In the end we will be implementing backup and disaster recovery strategies to ensure data integrity and availability in case of failures or incidents.

Conclusion:
IIT BHILAI has a great chance to improve student satisfaction, expedite administrative procedures, and increase data accessibility using the suggested query interface. Our goal is to provide a safe and user-friendly platform that supports the purpose and objectives of the institution by utilizing best practices and contemporary technologies.
We look forward to your support and collaboration in making this initiative a success.
